# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

-----------------------------

For this assignment we used react and vite to create an expense tracker app. The user can add expense title, amount, date and category. All information is mandatory to add, except from category. If the user doesn’t not write anything here a dash will be displayed in the table. After you press “add expense” the expense renders in a table underneath and you can also delete the expense. All the expenses gets summed up and the total displays.
